# 2021 Aquaculture Artificial Intelligence Idea Contest

## Overview
+ **Subject**: Free Topic (Food-organism utilization throughout the AI-based aquaculture industry)
+ **Home page**: http://sarc.jnu.ac.kr/contest/20211105/
+ **Motivation**:
  + Stable mass feeding management of food organisms is importance of 'artificial seed culture' industry
  + Problems cause serious economic loss in the aquaculture artificial seed production industry
    + Reduction of aquaculture food organisms (plankton)
    + Difficulty in managing mass culture/feeding of food organisms
    + Mass mortality in the process of seed production
    + Decreased utilization of food organisms by field

    > A sharp decline in marine food organisms (plankton) due to global warming and marine environmental pollution
  + It is necessary to select and concentrate the government R&D AI data and technology to solve fundamental problems such as instability and low productivity in the aquaculture industry
